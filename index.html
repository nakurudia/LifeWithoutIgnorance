<h1><b>About our Website:</b></h1> 
<p>This website will help connect you to the information you need to know when it comes to the hardships that different cultures had to face when this "new nation (USA)" was colonized by white settlers. Throughout school you are taught more about white history than any other race. This website is to show you how this nation was really built. It will show how every single race is and was important for the development of the United States of America.

<h2><b>You Should Know:</b></h2>
<p>I just want to stop the generational trend of Ignorance. I was inspired to do this website because I think that people can really come to understand oneanother if they only had the knowledge to do so. 2020 has been a hard time for everyone mentally and physically. Racial tenstion and lack of knowledge is dividing the Nation.
I believe everyone needs to take a look back at some history so we can learn from our mistakes and grow. Also this site is not to attack or offend white people in any way. It is just to educate everyone about POC, something that school systems should have started doing a long time ago. </a></p>
